# Progress Log

Claude Code updates **Current position** and adds a **Log** entry at the end of every task (`/finish-task`). Review notes from Cowork are added under the entry they refer to. Only Glyn or Alex add to **Decisions**, usually after a design review in Cowork.

## Current position
- **Phase:** 0
- **Last completed:** P0.1, P0.2, P0.4, P0.5 (plus the workflow setup commits `af261c2` and `bf232f3`). P0.3 was done by Glyn by hand on GitHub (reported; not verified by Claude Code).
- **Next open:** P0.6 (seed the dev site with test content), then P0.7 (diff the EPRA copy against `development`).
- **Scenario baseline:** not recorded yet (P1.5)

## Decisions
Record decisions that change the plan or design, with the date and who made them.
- 2026-10-19: Neuron AI 4 upgrade made Phase 2, before the refactor (Glyn).
- 2026-10-19: Extension model adopted. Extensions use our `ToolDefinition` contract, never Neuron classes (Glyn).
- 2026-10-19: Workflow clarified after Claude Code's first review:
  - commit prefixes are a task ID or `PLAN:`
  - the merge rule moves from "no regressions" to "all pass" at the end of Phase 3
  - planned deletions are covered by plan approval
  - mechanical conversions are covered by a registry test (Glyn)

### 2026-10-19: P0.4 + P0.5 Package .gitignore and archive of analysis docs
- Branch / PR: `task/P0.4-gitignore-and-archive` (PR not opened yet)
- Done:
  - P0.4: added `.gitignore` with `.DS_Store` and `.claude/settings.local.json` (personal Claude Code settings).
  - P0.5: moved the six analysis docs from the package root to `documentation/archive/` with `git mv` (history kept, contents unchanged): `BLOCKS_TOOLKIT_IMPLEMENTATION`, `FEATURE_COMPARISON`, `OPENAPI_OPPORTUNITY_ANALYSIS`, `TOOL_IMPROVEMENTS`, `VERSIONS_TOOLKIT_IMPLEMENTATION`, `VERSION_MANAGEMENT_CASE_STUDY`.
- Not done / left for later:
  - P0.4's "remove the committed `.DS_Store` files" was skipped: there were no tracked `.DS_Store` files, and none on disk in the package.
  - The four root scripts (`test_tools.php`, `repair_chat_history.php`, `validate_all_chats.php`, `test_container_search.php`) are deliberately kept and not ignored. P3.3 deletes them.
  - Three links in the archived docs now point at old root paths and are stale: `TOOL_IMPROVEMENTS.md` line 370 (`FEATURE_COMPARISON.md`), and `VERSIONS_TOOLKIT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` lines 229-230 (`OPENAPI_OPPORTUNITY_ANALYSIS.md`, `VERSION_MANAGEMENT_CASE_STUDY.md`). Left as they are because the docs are historical. Links between the moved docs still work, and links to `src/` files are unaffected.
- Checks: PHPUnit not run (not set up until P1.3) / Scenarios not run (P1.4) / no PHP changed, so no manual test on the dev site. Git checks: `git check-ignore` confirms the two entries are ignored and `vendor/` is not; the diff is 6 renames with 0 content changes and no deletions; no other references to the old root paths remain outside the archive.
- Plan changes proposed: tick P0.3 (done by Glyn on GitHub), P0.4 and P0.5 in `DELIVERY_PLAN.md` Phase 0, and update the Phase 0 heading to reflect that only P0.6 and P0.7 remain. Optionally reword P0.4 to say that no `.DS_Store` files were tracked.
- Questions for review: none.

### 2026-10-19: Setup
- Commit `af261c2`: delivery plan, extension design, CLAUDE.md, the start/finish commands, settings, PR template. Reviewed by Claude Code. Its seven clarification points were resolved in a `PLAN:` follow-up commit.
