# Immediate Update Action Plan

## Step 1: Update to Latest 1.x (Safe Update)
```bash
# This gets you up to date within the 1.x branch first
cd /Users/studio4/Repositories/neuron-ai
git checkout -b update-to-1.17.5
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/1.x

# Resolve any conflicts by keeping your composer.json and LogObserver.php
# Test thoroughly
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
composer test
```

## Step 2: Update to 2.x (Major Version)
```bash
# Only after Step 1 is successful
git checkout -b update-to-2.2.14
git merge 2.2.14

# Key areas to check after merge:
# 1. composer.json - remove psr/log if it was re-added
# 2. Any new LogObserver-related code
# 3. New event types in observability system
# 4. Breaking changes in Agent or Provider interfaces
```

## Step 3: Test Integration
```bash
# Make sure everything still works
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
composer analyse
composer test

# Test your Concrete CMS integration specifically
# Run any custom tests you have for the package
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Minor version updates within 1.x

- Provider interface changes

### High Risk
- Complete rewrite of logging system
- Breaking changes to Agent interface
- New required dependencies
